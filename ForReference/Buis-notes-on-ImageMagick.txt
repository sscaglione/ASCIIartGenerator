 ImageMagick

The default version of ImageMagick on the student machines is pretty old. To use a more recent version of ImageMagick, add the following directory to your PATH environmental variable:

~ccl/software/external/imagemagick/bin
In csh, you would do:

$ setenv PATH ~ccl/software/external/imagemagick/bin:$PATH
In bash, you would do:

$ export PATH=~ccl/software/external/imagemagick/bin:$PATH
In Python, you would do:

import os
os.environ['PATH'] = '~ccl/software/external/imagemagick/bin:' + os.environ['PATH']
Once the PATH is updated, you should be able to run composite -version and see ImageMagick 6.6.4-2.
